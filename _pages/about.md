I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Hong Kong, advised by [Prof. Chuan Wu](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~cwu/). My research focuses on distributed machine learning systems, with a particular interest in optimizing training efficiency, scalability, and performance for large-scale machine learning workloads.

Prior to joining HKU, I received my Bachelor's degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering at [Tsinghua University](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/).


## Education

- **PhD in Computer Science**, The University of Hong Kong, 2023-Present
- **Bachelor of Electronic Engineering**, Tsinghua University, 2019-2023

## Personal Interests

Outside of research, I enjoy [photography](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/610029a20000000001001b17), [skateboarding](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/610029a20000000001001b17), and [coffee](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/610029a20000000001001b17).

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating or just want to chat about research, tech, or any of my hobbies!
